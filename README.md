# Smart_Traffic_Optimization
To optimize traffic signal timings dynamically using image processing techniques to reduce congestion. The system utilizes real-time traffic images to determine vehicle density and allocates green signal time accordingly. It also prioritizes emergency vehicles by detecting them using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.
